Shared async watch client for Carillon

> [!WARNING]
> This crate is pre-release and unpublished. Its API will change without notice until the first tagged version.

carillon-core is the watcher shared by both Carillon frontends, the CLI daemon and the server. It connects to a source, watches for a change, and rings a content-free signal. Credential resolution, consumer fan-out, storage, and billing live in the frontends, so both run the same loop and a watcher fix lands in both at once. It is an async client rather than a sans-io layer, the way every Pimalaya consumer rebuilds its own client over io-imap and io-webdav.

The crate architecture is documented in the src/lib.rs header, and the design history lives under cairn/.

## AI disclosure

This project is developed with AI assistance. This section documents how, so users and downstream packagers can make informed decisions.

- **Tools**: Claude Code (Anthropic), Opus 4.8, invoked locally with a persistent project-scoped memory and a small set of repo-specific rules.
- **Used for**: Refactors, mechanical multi-file edits, boilerplate (feature gates, error enums, derive macros, trait impls), test scaffolding, doc polish, exploratory design conversations.
- **Not used for**: Engineering, critical code, git manipulation (commit, merge, rebase…), real-world tests.
- **Verification**: Every AI-assisted change is read, compiled, tested, and formatted before commit (`nix develop --command cargo check / cargo test / cargo fmt`). Behavioural correctness is verified against the relevant RFC or upstream spec, not assumed from the model output. Tests are never adjusted to fit AI-generated code; the code is adjusted to fit correct behaviour.
- **Limitations**: AI models occasionally produce code that compiles and passes tests but is subtly wrong: off-by-one errors, missed edge cases, plausible but nonexistent APIs, stale RFC references. The verification workflow catches most of this; it does not catch all of it. Bug reports are welcome and taken seriously.
